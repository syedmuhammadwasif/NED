As we have seen in the recent past the how the e-commerce is bomming and become multi trillion dollars industry. So we can see the that through Machine Learning Engineering we can optimize the reslut and profit.<br/>
So now I present the RFM model where we use to cluster with the customers according to their transactions.<br/>
Where we used Unsupervised Algorithm **K-means** Clustering and **elbow method** to make Cluster of the customer on the base of their transaction.<br/>
RFM segmentation is a well-known user segmentation strategy based on three user characteristics:<br/>
**Recency (R)**: When was the user’s most recent transaction?<br/>
**Frequency (F)**: How often does the customer transact?<br/>
**Monetary (M)**: What is the size of the user’s transaction?<br/>
